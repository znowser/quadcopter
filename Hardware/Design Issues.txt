Known design-issues

* Both GND pins on the 7 segment led display should be connected to Vcc.
* Reset from Raspberry missing pulldown resistor.
* Reset from pushbutton missing pulldown resistor.
* The connector to the raspberry is rotated in the wrong directory.
* It would be nice to have a led indicating reset of the AVR.
* Power connection to the Raspberry pi missing.
* 3V3 to the voltage converted should be taken from the raspberry instead of from the sensorcard.
* It would be nice to have a ISP connector direct to the AVR for programming without any peripheral components.
* It would be nice to support JTAG.
* The voltage converter outputs 5V where it should output 3V3.
* The PWM signal to Motor1 is connected to the wrong AVR-pin (should be PB7 instead of PB3).


Next version improvements

* New MPU: ATxmega128A4U, smaller, operates @ 32MHz, 3.6V
* 3V3 voltage regulator.
* only 3v3 on the whole card, no need for voltage dividers between avr-sensorcard and avr-rasp.
* may be an issue when interfacing with the speedcontrollers with only 3v3.
